Test task  


### Project Features  
* No Bootstrap
* Webpack v.4
* SCSS and components (prototype of own framework)
* Flexbox Grid for Grid (https://github.com/kristoferjoseph/flexboxgrid/; instead of own grid - why reinvent bicycle?)
* Usage the good old jQuery
* Usage library "Snap.svg"
* Usage ES6 syntax (a little, in fact as syntactic sugar)

### Don't worry, here're current features  
* You can move points since the third (control) point has been installed, only so
