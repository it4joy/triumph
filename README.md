# IndexBox
Test task  


### Project Features  
* No Bootstrap
* Webpack v.4
* SCSS and components (prototype of own framework)
* Flexbox Grid for Grid (https://github.com/kristoferjoseph/flexboxgrid/; instead of own grid - why reinvent bicycle?)
* Using library "Snap.svg"
* Using ES6 syntax (a little, in fact as syntactic sugar)


### Should to implement  
* `@media` for each component move to the relevant file, in main file with media queries should to left only breakpoints and SCSS mixins (look at the Rustyle)
